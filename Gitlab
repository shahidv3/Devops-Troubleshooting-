Steps to Troubleshoot and Resolve the Issue

1. Check PostgreSQL Connection Limits

	•	Log in to the PostgreSQL database and check the current connection limits:

SELECT max_conn, used_conn FROM pg_stat_database WHERE datname = 'gitlabhq_production';


	•	Check the current settings for max_connections:

SHOW max_connections;



2. Increase max_connections in PostgreSQL

If the max_connections setting is too low, increase it:
	•	Open the PostgreSQL configuration file (usually postgresql.conf):

sudo nano /etc/postgresql/<version>/main/postgresql.conf


	•	Update the max_connections parameter:

max_connections = 500  # Example value


	•	Restart PostgreSQL to apply changes:

sudo systemctl restart postgresql



3. Monitor and Reduce Active Connections

If increasing max_connections is not feasible, monitor and reduce unnecessary connections:
	•	List active connections:

SELECT pid, usename, application_name, client_addr FROM pg_stat_activity;


	•	Terminate idle or unnecessary connections:

SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'idle' AND usename = 'gitlab';



4. Check GitLab’s Database Configuration

GitLab’s connection pooling may need adjustment. Check the puma or unicorn configuration:
	•	Open GitLab’s configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb


	•	Look for the database connection pool settings (e.g., db_pool). Increase it if necessary:

postgresql['pool'] = 20  # Example value


	•	Reconfigure and restart GitLab:

sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
sudo gitlab-ctl restart



5. Check for High Load or Resource Constraints

	•	Ensure the server has sufficient resources (CPU, RAM). High resource usage can lead to issues.
	•	Use commands like top or htop to check system usage.

6. Inspect GitLab Logs

Check for other issues in the GitLab logs that might indicate a root cause:

sudo gitlab-ctl tail

7. Use Connection Pooling

	•	Implement a connection pooling mechanism such as PgBouncer to manage database connections efficiently.

8. Scale the Database

If the issue persists, consider scaling the database (e.g., moving to a larger instance or adding replicas).

Temporary Fix

If you need a quick fix to get GitLab back up:
	•	Restart PostgreSQL:

sudo systemctl restart postgresql


	•	Restart GitLab services:

sudo gitlab-ctl restart



Long-Term Recommendations

	•	Monitor PostgreSQL connection usage regularly.
	•	Optimize application and database queries.
	•	Scale infrastructure if your GitLab instance is serving many users or repositories.
